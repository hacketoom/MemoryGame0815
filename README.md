### How to Use it

Just open the `index.html` in your browser.
As soon as you click the first card on the deck, the timer will start counting. After 10 moves the star-rating will be reduced, and the rating will drop to 1 star when you made 30 moves.
After all cards on the deck have been matched, you will be shown a message telling you the time it took you to finish the game, as well as your star-rating.
